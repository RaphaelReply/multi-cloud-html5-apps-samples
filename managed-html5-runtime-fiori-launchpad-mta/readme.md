![diagram](diagram.png)


## Description

This is an example of an SAP Fiori app that is accessed by a managed application router. The SAP Fiori app is exposed to the SAP Launchpad service and is visible in the content manager of the launchpad. The app is deployed to the HTML5 Application Repository via the Cloud Foundry environment  and uses the Authentication & Authorization service (XSUAA service) and the destination service. 

The web app that is contained in the `uimodule.zip` defines the following properties in the `manifest.json` file. Otherwise, the correspoding values in the `mta.yaml` descriptor need to be updated as well.

```JSON
{
  "sap.cloud": {
    "public": true,
    "service": "cloud.service"
  },
  "sap.app": {
    "id": "com.myorg.FLP",
    "applicationVersion": {
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  },
  "sap.ui5": {
    "dependencies": {
        "minUI5Version": "1.65.0"
    }
  }
}
```


>  The SAP Fiori app consume the Northwind odata.org public service, to use instead a CAP service with required authentication look at [optional-self-hosted-backend](../optional-self-hosted-backend/)
